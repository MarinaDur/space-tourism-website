## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Links

- Live Site URL: [space-tourism-website](https://space-tourism-website-reactjs.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

Would like to get better at planning and how to approach the layout.

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba/Kevin Powell](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel) - This is how Kevin Powell made the website. Initially I did everything myself but I knew it wasn't really sustainble so I wanted to see how I can approach it differently.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to Kevin Powel and Scrimba, with their help I changed the layout and the results are much less css and more sustainable code.
